# UFOs

- Create a webpage displaying UFO sightings data.  Include filtering functionality based on any combination of the 5 primary fields (date, city, state, country & shape).

## Resources
- Software: Python 3.8.8, Visual Studio Code 1.57.1
- the Data was provided via data.js file

## Results
- The webpage is easy to use and can be filtered using any combination of 5 fields in the 'Filter Search' on the left hand side.
  To filter the UFO sightings you can type the criteria you wish to filter the data by in the appropriate fields.

## Summary
- Drawback
	- A drawback to this filtering design is the text input boxes.  Text input boxes require the user use correct spelling and formatting to get desired results.
- Recommendations
	- To assist the user in easily resetting the search, I would recommend adding a 'reset' button to clear the input fields.
	- Additionally, you could replace the text input boxes with drop downs of available options.
	- I would also recommend a results counter that would show the number of result as the filtering is applied.
